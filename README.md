Hello, I'm Dillon, and I'm happy you're here!

Take a look around, and feel free to steal anything you see that could help you. This isn't a code repository, it's a collaboration station.
Feel free to contact me at: dillondoespython@gmail.com for any concerns you may have. I have regular plans to make updates and more repo's in the future. 

P.S. I am always looking for a new way to dumb down my code in order to be as elegant and readable as possible, if you have any suggestions you believe could assist me in that, feel free to note it accordingly. 

Best, 
Dillon
